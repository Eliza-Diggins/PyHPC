Developer Description
---------------------
The core structure of the ``yt`` project's plotting is built on the ``matplotlib`` plotting library. In this case,
the user may choose to use any of the implemented ``plotting`` routines described; and for each, the plot may
be arbitrarily attached to an ``axes`` object to render it in a more complex plot.
